### Boat Components
```cpp
UStaticMeshComponent* BoatMesh;        // Your custom boat mesh from /Game/Boat/Boat/StaticMeshes
USpringArmComponent* SpringArm;       // Camera boom for cinematic view
UCameraComponent* Camera;              // Dynamic third-person camera
```

### Custom Boat Mesh System
- **Custom Mesh**: Uses your boat mesh from `/Game/Boat/Boat/StaticMeshes/Boat`
- **Single Component**: Clean design with just one mesh instead of multiple basic shapes
- **Proper Orientation**: No rotation needed since you fixed it in Blender
- **Proper Physics**: Custom mesh has full physics simulation and collision
- **Scaled Up**: 1.5x larger for better visibility and presence

### Smooth WASD Movement System
- **W/S Keys**: Forward and backward movement with realistic boat acceleration
- **A/D Keys**: Left and right turning with realistic boat turning physics
- **Smooth Controls**: Continuous analog input for natural boat handling
- **Realistic Physics**: Uses thrust forces and torque for authentic boat feel
- **Speed Limiting**: Maximum speed cap prevents unrealistic acceleration

### Movement Physics
- **Throttle Input**: W/S keys control forward/backward thrust (45,000N max force)
- **Steering Input**: A/D keys control turning torque (150,000N·m max torque) 
- **Realistic Drag**: Water drag increases with speed for authentic feel
- **Angular Damping**: Boat doesn't spin unrealistically when turning
- **Momentum**: Boat maintains momentum and doesn't stop instantly

### Cinematic Camera System
- **Position**: Positioned behind and above boat (600cm arm length)
- **Angle**: Higher angle (-30°) to showcase the complete boat design
- **FOV**: 70° wide field of view to capture the full boat
- **Dynamic Effects**: 
  - Subtle camera shake during rowing strokes
  - Leans with boat turns for realistic feel
  - Pulls back slightly when moving fast
  - Rises during high-speed movement

### Camera Physics Parameters
```cpp
float CameraShakeIntensity = 2.f;     // Rowing stroke camera shake amount
float CameraFollowSpeed = 3.f;        // Smooth camera interpolation speed
TargetArmLength = 400.f;               // Close but clear view of boat
BaseRotation = FRotator(-25.f, 0.f, 0.f); // Downward angle to see boat
```

### Dynamic Camera Features
1. **Rowing Shake**: Subtle camera movement during power strokes
2. **Velocity Response**: Camera adjusts based on boat speed
3. **Turn Banking**: Camera leans slightly during turns
4. **Smooth Interpolation**: Natural camera movement without jaring
5. **Collision Detection**: Camera avoids clipping through objects

### Rowing Physics Parameters
```cpp
float OarForce = 25000.f;             // Force per oar stroke (Newtons)
float OarLeverArm = 150.f;            // Distance from boat center to oar pivot (cm)
float StrokeRecoveryTime = 0.8f;      // Time for oar to return to neutral (seconds)
float StrokePowerDuration = 0.3f;     // Time during which stroke applies force (seconds)
float MaxSpeed = 800.f;               // Realistic rowing boat top speed (cm/s)
```

### Oar Animation System
1. **Power Stroke (0.3s)**: Oar sweeps from 30° forward to -30° backward
2. **Recovery Stroke (0.5s)**: Oar returns to 10° ready position
3. **Visual Sync**: Oar movements perfectly timed with force application
4. **Camera Response**: Camera shakes subtly during power strokes

### Rowing Mechanics
1. **Stroke Initiation**: Press A (left oar) or D (right oar) to start a stroke
2. **Power Phase**: First 0.3 seconds apply decreasing force + oar animation + camera shake
3. **Recovery Phase**: Next 0.5 seconds no force applied (oar out of water)
4. **Force Distribution**: Forward thrust + turning moment based on oar position
5. **Realistic Turning**: 
   - Left oar only = turn right + camera leans
   - Right oar only = turn left + camera leans
   - Both oars together = straight forward
   - Alternating oars = efficient forward motion

### Boat Dimensions & Physics
```cpp
// Main Hull: Realistic boat proportions
Scale: FVector(5.0f, 2.0f, 0.8f)     // 5m long, 2m wide, 0.8m tall
Mass: 180kg                          // Typical small boat weight
Cabin: FVector(1.8f, 1.6f, 1.2f)    // Wheelhouse dimensions
Roof: FVector(2.0f, 1.8f, 0.2f)     // Blue roof covering cabin
Buoyancy: Aggressive floating system // Never sinks, always recovers
```

### Visual Design Features
1. **Proper Hull Shape**: Rectangular hull scaled to look like actual boat
2. **Cabin Structure**: White wheelhouse positioned forward of rowing area
3. **Blue Roof**: Weather protection on top of cabin
4. **Flag System**: Mast extending from roof with yellow triangular flag
5. **Rowing Cockpit**: Open area behind cabin for rowing operations
6. **Safety Rails**: Gunwales along both sides of boat
7. **Boat Ends**: Pointed bow for cutting water, flat transom stern
8. **Realistic Oars**: 3-meter oars properly positioned for rowing

## ?? WaterManager Class

### Purpose
Central coordinator for all water physics interactions

### Wave Simulation
```cpp
float WaterLevel = 0.f;               // Base water height
float WaveAmplitude = 8.f;            // Wave height variation
float WaveFrequency = 1.2f;           // Wave frequency multiplier
float WaveSpeed = 1.5f;               // Wave animation speed
```

### Wave Calculation Formula
```cpp
float Wave1 = Sin((X * 0.005f) + (Time * Speed)) * Amplitude;
float Wave2 = Sin((Y * 0.003f) + (Time * Speed * 1.3f)) * Amplitude * 0.7f;
float Wave3 = Sin(((X + Y) * 0.002f) + (Time * Speed * 0.8f)) * Amplitude * 0.5f;
WaterHeight = WaterLevel + Wave1 + Wave2 + Wave3;
```
